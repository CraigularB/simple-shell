simple-shell
============

This is a project to replicate very very basic shell functionality for fun.

I'll mostly be playing around with C++ and new C++11 functionality using Visual Studio. This is not meant to be a usable shell, at least not right away (if ever). Instead I view it as an experimentation testbed for me to try new things!
